question:
 Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a 
guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched"



Explanation:

The Math.ceil() function is used to get the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

The Math.random() function is used to get a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1] that is, from 0 
(inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive), which you can then scale to your desired range.
